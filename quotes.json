If I said the quote to someone, \"Knowledge is power, France is Bacon\", they nodded knowingly. Or someone might say, \"Knowledge is power\" and I'd finish the quote \"France is Bacon\" and they wouldn't look at me like I'd said something very odd, but thoughtfully agree. I did ask a teacher what did \"Knowledge is power, France is bacon\" mean and got a full 10-minute explanation of the \"knowledge is power\" bit but nothing on \"France is bacon\". When I prompted further explanation by saying \"France is bacon?\" in a questioning tone I just got a \"yes\". At 12 I didn't have the confidence to press it further. I just accepted it as something I'd never understand.\n\nIt wasn't until years later I saw it written down that the penny dropped.\n"
