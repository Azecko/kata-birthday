## What's that ?
This repository is a NodeJS script that send emails to remind the birthday of someone (from a JSON file).

## Make it work
1. Clone the repository on your computer.
2. Type `npm install` to install [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) (required to make the program work).
3. Rename the file `.env_example` in `.env`.
4. Insert your own data in the `.env` file.
5. Run `node index.js` to start the program
6. Put the birthdays data as you want in `birthdays.json`.
7. Enjoy !

## Greetings
Thanks to [@ponsfrilus](https://github.com/ponsfrilus) for the help on the script.
